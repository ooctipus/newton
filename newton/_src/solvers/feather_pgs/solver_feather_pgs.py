class SolverFeatherPGS(SolverBase):
    """A semi-implicit integrator using symplectic Euler that operates
    on reduced (also called generalized) coordinates to simulate articulated rigid body dynamics
    based on Featherstone's composite rigid body algorithm (CRBA).

    See: Featherstone, Roy. Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms. Springer US, 2014.

    Instead of maximal coordinates :attr:`~newton.State.body_q` (rigid body positions) and :attr:`~newton.State.body_qd`
    (rigid body velocities) as is the case in :class:`~newton.solvers.SolverSemiImplicit` and :class:`~newton.solvers.SolverXPBD`,
    :class:`~newton.solvers.SolverFeatherPGS` uses :attr:`~newton.State.joint_q` and :attr:`~newton.State.joint_qd` to represent
    the positions and velocities of joints without allowing any redundant degrees of freedom.

    After constructing :class:`~newton.Model` and :class:`~newton.State` objects this time-integrator
    may be used to advance the simulation state forward in time.

    Note:
        Unlike :class:`~newton.solvers.SolverSemiImplicit` and :class:`~newton.solvers.SolverXPBD`, :class:`~newton.solvers.SolverFeatherPGS`
        does not simulate rigid bodies with nonzero mass as floating bodies if they are not connected through any joints.
        Floating-base systems require an explicit free joint with which the body is connected to the world,
        see :meth:`newton.ModelBuilder.add_joint_free`.

    Semi-implicit time integration is a variational integrator that
    preserves energy, however it not unconditionally stable, and requires a time-step
    small enough to support the required stiffness and damping forces.

    See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-implicit_Euler_method

    This solver uses the routines from :class:`~newton.solvers.SolverSemiImplicit` to simulate particles, cloth, and soft bodies.

        """
        Args:
            model (Model): the model to be simulated.
            angular_damping (float, optional): Angular damping factor. Defaults to 0.05.
            update_mass_matrix_interval (int, optional): How often to update the mass matrix (every n-th time the
                :meth:`step` function gets called). The cadence flag is evaluated on the host each step, so under
                CUDA graph capture the 0/1 pattern is baked at capture time: with K steps captured per graph,
                replays repeat the captured K-step pattern, so only intervals whose pattern fits the capture are
                honored (a 2-step graph captured at step 0 bakes [1, 0]; interval=2 is exact while interval>=3
                silently degrades to an effective interval of 2). Intervals must divide or equal the captured
                step pattern to behave as requested. Per-articulation limit-count changes still trigger a
                device-side mass refresh on skipped steps. Defaults to 1.
            friction_smoothing (float, optional): The delta value for the Huber norm (see :func:`warp.math.norm_huber`) used for the friction velocity normalization. Defaults to 1.0.
            enable_contact_friction (bool, optional): Enables Coulomb friction contacts inside the PGS solve. Defaults to True.
            contact_friction_gap_threshold (float, optional): Only build friction rows for contacts with
                ``phi <= contact_friction_gap_threshold``. This mirrors PhysX's separate friction-anchor
                distance threshold while leaving speculative normal rows intact. Defaults to ``inf`` to
                preserve legacy FeatherPGS behavior.
            contact_friction_position_iterations (int, optional): Number of biased PGS position
                iterations that solve contact-friction rows. ``-1`` preserves legacy FeatherPGS
                behavior by solving friction in every position iteration; ``0`` skips position-pass
                friction entirely; ``N > 0`` solves friction only in the final ``N`` position
                iterations. Velocity-only post iterations always solve friction every iteration,
                matching PhysX PGS's documented default of friction in the last three position
                iterations and all velocity iterations. Defaults to ``-1``.
            contact_friction_shared_anchor (bool, optional): If true, friction rows use the midpoint
                between the two contact witness points as the Jacobian point on both bodies. Normal
                rows keep their original witness points. This avoids a tangential force couple when
                the witnesses are separated along the contact normal. Defaults to False.
            contact_friction_anchor_limit (int, optional): Experimental PhysX-style patch-friction
                approximation. If positive, only this many contacts in a contiguous same-shape contact
                run receive friction rows; normal rows are still created for every contact. When a
                contiguous patch has more than one selected friction anchor, the effective Coulomb
                coefficient is halved to mimic PhysX's two-anchor friction scaling. Defaults to 0
                (disabled).
            contact_friction_scale (float, optional): Multiplies the effective Coulomb coefficient
                used by generated friction rows. This is a diagnostic hook for matching solver-prep
                semantics such as PhysX's per-friction-anchor scaling; it does not affect normal
                contact rows. Defaults to 1.0.
            contact_shared_anchor (bool, optional): If true, all contact rows use the midpoint between
                the two witness points as the Jacobian point on both bodies, matching PhysX contact
                prep's single ``contact.point`` lever arm. ``phi`` is still computed from the original
                witness points. Defaults to False.
            enable_joint_limits (bool, optional): Enforce joint position limits as unilateral PGS
                constraints. Each active limit side adds one constraint row. Supported with
                ``pgs_kernel="loop"`` and ``pgs_kernel="tiled_row"``; the ``"tiled_contact"``
                and ``"streaming"`` PGS kernels are *not* compatible.  Defaults to False.
            joint_limit_activation_gap (float, optional): Distance from a finite lower or upper
                position limit at which a joint-limit PGS row becomes active. A lower row is
                allocated when ``q <= lower + gap``; an upper row is allocated when
                ``q >= upper - gap``. ``inf`` preserves the historical behavior of allocating all
                finite limit rows every step. Must be non-negative and not NaN. Defaults to ``inf``.
            enable_joint_velocity_limits (bool, optional): Enforce joint velocity limits
                (``model.joint_velocity_limit``) as per-DOF PGS constraints. Mirrors the
                PhysX velocity-limit row: when ``|qdot_i| > qdot_max_i``, a single
                signed-Jacobian row is added that projects ``qdot_i`` back onto the
                bilateral box ``[-qdot_max_i, +qdot_max_i]`` through the articulated-body
                response ``J M^-1 J^T + cfm``, so momentum redistributes correctly across
                the articulation (rather than a naive joint-space clip which breaks
                multi-body Newton's third law). No Baumgarte bias.

                Only supported with ``pgs_mode="matrix_free"``; passing any other
                ``pgs_mode`` together with ``enable_joint_velocity_limits=True`` raises
                :class:`NotImplementedError` at construction. Defaults to False.
            pgs_iterations (int, optional): Number of Gauss-Seidel iterations to apply per frame. Defaults to 12.
            pgs_velocity_iterations (int, optional): Additional matrix-free iterations using a velocity-only RHS
                after integrating positions with the biased PGS result. This mirrors the PhysX-style split where
                geometric bias corrects positions first, then final velocity iterations run without Baumgarte bias.
                Only supported with ``pgs_mode="matrix_free"``. Defaults to 0.
            pgs_beta (float, optional): ERP style position correction factor. Defaults to 0.2.
            pgs_cfm (float, optional): Compliance/regularization added to the Delassus diagonal. Defaults to 1.0e-6.
            dense_contact_compliance (float, optional): Normal contact compliance [m/N] applied
                only to dense articulated contact rows. Converted to an impulse-space diagonal
                term using ``compliance / dt^2``. Defaults to 0.0.
            speculative_dense_contact_compliance (float, optional): Additional normal contact
                compliance [m/N] applied only to dense articulated contact rows with ``phi > 0``.
                This leaves penetrating dense contacts at the base compliance while softening
                separated/speculative contact normals. Converted to an impulse-space diagonal
                term using ``compliance / dt^2``. Defaults to 0.0.
            pgs_omega (float, optional): Successive over-relaxation factor for the PGS sweep. Defaults to 1.0.
            pgs_velocity_omega (float | None, optional): Relaxation factor for the velocity-only post-pass.
                Defaults to ``pgs_omega`` when unset.
            pgs_velocity_drive_mode (str, optional): Drive-row treatment during velocity-only post-pass
                iterations. ``"freeze"`` keeps PhysX-style drive impulses from the biased position
                solve and lets only contacts, friction, and limits clean up velocity residuals;
                ``"active"`` continues updating drive rows during the velocity-only pass. Defaults
                to ``"freeze"``.
            dense_max_constraints (int, optional): Maximum number of dense (articulation) contact constraint
                rows stored per world. Free rigid body contacts are stored separately, bounded by
                mf_max_constraints. Defaults to 32.
            pgs_warmstart (bool, optional): Re-use impulses from the previous frame when contacts persist. Defaults to False.
            pgs_mode (str, optional): PGS mode. "dense" builds the full Delassus matrix C = J*H^{-1}*J^T
                and solves in impulse space (Gauss-Seidel) for all contacts. "split" uses the dense
                path for articulated bodies and a cheaper matrix-free PGS path for free rigid body
                contacts. "matrix_free" skips C entirely, recomputes J*v each iteration, and uses only
                the diagonal for preconditioning — O(max_constraints) memory instead of
                O(max_constraints^2). Defaults to "split".
            pgs_schedule (str, optional): Matrix-free row ordering. ``"interleaved"`` preserves the
                legacy per-iteration dense+matrix-free sweep. ``"contact_then_internal"`` runs all
                contact/friction sweeps first, then all internal articulation sweeps (drive, joint
                limits, joint velocity limits). ``"physx_grasp"`` approximates PhysX's two-pass
                grabbing order by solving drive/position-limit rows first, then contacts/friction,
                then joint velocity limits. Defaults to ``"interleaved"``.
            friction_mode (str, optional): Per-row Coulomb friction strategy used by the
                ``pgs_mode="matrix_free"`` path. ``"current"`` (default) is the baseline
                isotropic Coulomb cone projection that has been the FeatherPGS behavior
                to date. ``"bisection"`` runs a RAISim-style bisection on the normal
                impulse λ_n with the 2x2 tangential sub-problem re-solved at each
                probe — ported from Miles Macklin's ``raisim/kernels.py``; wired in
                the FPGS Friction Modes 5/13 slice.
                ``"bisection_desaxce"`` (FPGS Friction Modes 6/13) runs the same
                RAISim bisection with the de Saxce maximum-dissipation bias
                correction (Le Lidec & Carpentier 2024): ``μ · ‖c_T‖`` is added to
                the normal target velocity so sliding contacts also minimise the
                ``r_mdp_dir`` / ``r_ds_compl`` residuals.
                ``"coulomb_newton"`` (FPGS Friction Modes 7/13) runs Gilles
                Daviet's scalar bracketed-Newton on the tangential-force
                ratio alpha: a per-row 1D Newton iteration on the 3x3 Delassus
                block that solves the Coulomb cone coupling directly (no
                lagged de Saxce correction, no quartic).  Ported from
                ``artifacts/2026-04-16-slack-raisim/coulomb_root_finding_warp.py``.
                ``friction_mode`` is matrix-free only — passing
                any value other than ``"current"`` with ``pgs_mode="dense"`` or
                ``pgs_mode="split"`` raises ``ValueError``.
                Defaults to ``"current"``.
            mf_max_constraints (int, optional): Maximum number of matrix-free constraints per world. Defaults to 512.
            cholesky_kernel (str, optional): "tiled", "loop", or "auto" for Cholesky factorization. Defaults to "auto".
            trisolve_kernel (str, optional): "tiled", "loop", or "auto" for triangular solve. Defaults to "auto".
            hinv_jt_kernel (str, optional): "tiled", "par_row", or "auto" for H^{-1}J^T. Defaults to "auto".
            delassus_kernel (str, optional): "tiled", "par_row_col", or "auto" for Delassus accumulation
                (C = J * H^{-1} * J^T). "tiled" uses a streaming CUDA kernel that chunks shared memory
                and scales to any constraint count. "par_row_col" launches one thread per matrix element.
                "auto" selects "tiled" when DOFs exceed the threshold. Defaults to "auto".
            pgs_kernel (str, optional): "loop", "tiled_row", or "tiled_contact" for PGS solve. Defaults to "tiled_row".
            delassus_chunk_size (int, optional): Chunk size (in constraint rows) for the streaming Delassus
                kernel. Controls how many rows of J and Y are loaded into shared memory at once.
                None selects automatically based on shared memory heuristics. Defaults to None.
            pgs_chunk_size (int, optional): Chunk size (in contacts, i.e. groups of 3 constraint rows)
                for the streaming PGS kernel. Controls how many block-rows of the Delassus matrix are
                preloaded into shared memory at once. 1 = current streaming behavior (one block-row
                at a time). None defaults to 1. Defaults to None.
            small_dof_threshold (int, optional): DOF threshold for "auto" kernel selection. Defaults to 12.
            use_parallel_streams (bool, optional): Dispatch size groups on separate CUDA streams.
                Defaults to True.
            drive_mode (str, optional): Joint target drive implementation.
                ``"augmented"`` keeps the legacy FeatherPGS implicit-PD path
                that folds drive stiffness into the articulated mass matrix.
                ``"physx_pgs"`` creates one dense PGS constraint row per
                driven scalar DOF and updates its drive impulse with PhysX's
                force-drive PGS formula each Gauss-Seidel iteration. The
                PhysX row mode is currently supported only with
                ``pgs_mode="matrix_free"``. Defaults to ``"augmented"``.
            effort_limit_mode (str, optional): Retained only for legacy callers.
                FeatherPGS now always clamps the explicit-PD actuator-drive contribution
                (``u0`` in the augmented-row buffer) before it is added to
                ``state.joint_tau``, matching MuJoCo's ``actuatorfrcrange`` and PhysX
                articulation drive ``maxForce``. The rigid / passive / external bucket
                is left uncapped; the implicit-PD drive response carried by
                ``H_tilde^{-1}`` is not clamped. ``"actuator"`` (the new default) is
                the only supported value. ``"net"`` is rejected with ``ValueError``.
        Auto selection behavior:
            - auto: size > threshold -> tiled, else loop/par_row.
            - Delassus auto/tiled: streaming kernel (handles any constraint count via chunking).

    Unlike tiled_contact which loads the entire Delassus matrix into shared memory,
    this kernel keeps only lambda and auxiliaries in shared memory and streams
    block-rows of C on demand. This enables handling much larger constraint counts
    (hundreds of contacts) at the cost of increased global memory bandwidth.

    When pgs_chunk_size > 1, multiple block-rows are preloaded into shared memory
    at once, reducing the number of global memory round-trips per PGS iteration.

        - For each chunk of pgs_chunk_size contacts:
