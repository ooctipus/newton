"""Half-space AABBs for infinite planes: tilt slack vs. axis-align clamping.

The broad phase clamps an infinite plane's AABB at the surface along world
axes the plane normal aligns with, so shapes far above an axis-aligned ground
stop being narrow-phase candidates. A plane whose normal is only NEARLY
axis-aligned rises by ``lat * r`` at lateral distance ``r`` from its anchor
(``lat`` = norm of the two non-aligned normal components); clamping such a
plane at the anchor height silently drops resting contacts far from the
anchor — a sphere resting 600 m out on a floor tilted 0.05 degrees loses its
ground contact and falls through. The clamp must therefore only engage when
the worst-case rise over the supported reach stays within the AABB's contact
gap enlargement, and carry that rise as slack.
